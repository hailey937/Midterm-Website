      <p>With its distinctive running walk and smooth gaits, it’s no wonder that the Tennessee Walking Horse has become such a popular riding mount. Today, you’ll find these horses in the show ring, on the trails, and even in lesson barns, thanks to their docile personality and laid-back temperaments.</p>
      <p>This breed has excellent stamina and is versatile enough to accommodate beginning riders as well as more advanced horsemen. These horses come in many different coat colors and feature a spirited, beautiful appearance that only enhances their performance both in and out of the show ring.</p>

      <h4>Tennessee Walking Horse History and Origins</h4>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12 text-indent">
      <p>The breed originated in the Bluegrass region of Tennessee during the late 19th century. Farmers in the region were looking for a horse that could not only work in the fields, but that could also be ridden under saddle comfortably. To create this smooth-riding, strong horse, farmers selectively bred together Thoroughbreds, Canadian Pacers, Saddlebreds, Morgans, American Standardbreds, and Narragansett Pacers.</p>
      <p>The result of crossing these breeds was a gaited horse with a natural running walk. That horse could do both ranch work and offer its owners a comfortable, smooth ride. The breed gained in popularity and in 1935, the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders & Exhibitors Association was founded.</p>
      <p>In 2000, the Tennessee Walker became the official state horse of Tennessee.</p>

      <h4>Colors and Markings</h4>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12 text-indent">
      <p>You can find Tennessee Walkers in many different coat colors, and the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders’ & Exhibits’ Association accepts almost any coat color into the registry. Some of the most common coat colors include bay, black, chestnut, white, grey, dun, palomino, and roan.</p>
      <p>Tennessee Walkers also occur in various coat patterns. Overo, Sabino, Tobiano, and Tovero coat patterns are common and the brilliant colors only enhance the impressive presence of this breed. No matter what coat color or pattern you prefer, you’ll probably find it represented within this breed.</p>

      <h4>Diet and Nutrition</h4>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12 text-indent">
      <p>Tennessee Walking horses require a healthy balance of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, minerals, vitamins, and water in their diet. They can sustain on fresh grass, hay, rolled oats, and other grains, such as barley and bran. Treats, such as carrots and apples, can be given in moderation.</p>

      <h4>Is the Tennessee Walking Horse Right for You?</h4>

  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12 text-indent">
      <p>Versatile, docile, and with a laid-back temperament, the Tennessee Walker can make a great choice for many riders. Because of their smooth gaits, they’re ideal for older riders or for riders with back pain and other physical issues. At the same time, the Tennessee Walker can be a powerful show ring competitor, so younger riders who are looking for a great show horse may also turn to this breed.</p>
      <p>One of the benefits of the Tennessee Walker is that you can do a lot with a single horse. A well-trained horse can learn to trail ride, to compete, and even to teach younger children how to ride. No matter how much riding experience you have or what discipline you’re looking to participate in, you can probably find a Tennessee Walker out there who has the skills and temperament that you’re looking for.</p>
      <p>These horses are usually easy keepers, which can save you money in feed bills. Some show Tennessee Walkers do develop health issues, like back pain and Navicular disease, and hoof issues can result, especially when horses are shown in padded or built-up shoes. Tennessee Walkers ridden for pleasure and kept in standard, flat shoes usually have minimal health issues, as long as they receive appropriate care. Remember that a horse’s breeding can affect its health and risk for health issues, so consult a knowledgeable vet when buying a horse.</p>
      <p>If you’re thinking that the Tennessee Walking Horse is the breed for you, then it’s important to ride a few different horses from this breed, especially if you haven’t ridden a gaited horse before. Gaited horses are great and very comfortable, but they move differently than non-gaited breeds. Try to find a trainer who can teach you how to get the most out of a gaited horse, and who can give you some experience so you can determine just what you want in your ideal gaited horse. The Tennessee Walker feels different from other gaited horse breeds, like the Paso Fino, so be sure that this breed works for you before you go shopping for your new horse.</p>

      <h4>How to Adopt or Buy a Tennessee Walking Horse</h4>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12 text-indent">
      <p>The purchase price to adopt or buy a Tennessee Walker ranges widely from $1,000 to $4,000. Pricing is dependent on age, health, whether the horse is coming from a rescue or a breeder, and any notable characteristics, such as lineage.</p>
      <p>When choosing a horse, be on the lookout for red flags. For rescues, check that the organization is a registered nonprofit with a 501(c)(3) status, which means it had to go through more checks to be considered safe and legitimate. Also, especially for breeders, make sure you can receive documentation on where the horse was bred, its lineage, and any health history. If none of this is provided, you might not be dealing with a quality organization.</p>
      <p>Spend plenty of time with the horse while it's still in the hands of the organization, so you can get to know it and make sure it's as healthy as the organization says. Look for any lameness, pain, trouble breathing, or other obvious signs of illness. You don't want to end up bringing home a special-needs horse when you are not prepared to care for one.</p>
