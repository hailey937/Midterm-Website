      <p>The American quarter horse is one of North America's most popular and oldest horse breeds. The breed's popularity stems from its many positive attributes, including its gentle nature, versatility, beauty, speed, agility, and loyalty. Quarter horses are suitable for all levels of riders and owners, as they tend to be friendly with people and easy to train. Theyâ€™ve been used as race horses, as well as working ranch horses and family pets. They have a sturdy build and come in many colors; sorrel (brownish red) is the most common.</p>

      <h4>American Quarter Horse History and Origins</h4>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12 text-indent">
      <p>The American quarter horse descends from Spanish and English horses used in the American colonies in the 1600s. These horses were crossed with local breeds, including the Chickasaw horse. The breed's name came from its dominance in quarter-mile races, and its sure-footedness made it a favorite among settlers.</p>
      <p>Later, the quarter horse played an enormous role in the pioneers' westward expansion. The breed's agility proved invaluable to cowboys, farmers, and those who needed reliable transportation over rough terrain. Although the breed has existed since the 1600s, the American Quarter Horse Association registry wasn't established until 1940.</p>

      <h4>Colors and Markings</h4>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12 text-indent">
      <p>American quarter horses come in a variety of solid colors, roans, palominos, grays, grullo, buckskins, and duns. The brownish-red sorrel is the color most commonly seen in the breed. Moreover, white markings on the face and legs are common. Spotted patterns are accepted in the American Quarter Horse Association registry, as long as owners can prove both the sire and dam were registered quarter horses.</p>

      <h4>Diet and Nutrition</h4>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12 text-indent">
      <p>American quarter horses require a healthy balance of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, minerals, vitamins, and water in their diet. They can sustain on fresh grass, hay, rolled oats, and other grains, such as barley and bran. Treats, such as carrots and apples, can be given in moderation. As a general rule, American quarter horses eat between 1.5 and 2 percent of their body weight each day. That means a 1,000-pound horse requires 15 to 20 pounds of food daily.</p>

      <h4>Is the American Quarter Horse Right for You?</h4>

    <div class="col-sm-12 text-indent">
      <p>With a calm, gentle demeanor, this breed is the ideal choice for families and beginning riders. American quarter horses typically have a steady temperament, but this does not mean they are slow to learn. Their intuitive nature makes them easy to train for ranch work or competition, and the same is true for recreational purposes. They need very little guidance from riders once trained and tend to be "easy keepers" that thrive on good pasture or hay.</p>

      <h4>How to Adopt or Buy an American Quarter Horse</h4>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12 text-indent">
      <p>The purchase price to adopt or buy an American quarter horse ranges widely from $1,000 to $4,000. Pricing is dependent on age, health, whether the horse is coming from a rescue or a breeder, and any notable characteristics, such as lineage.</p>
      <p>When choosing a horse, be on the lookout for red flags. For rescues, check that the organization is a registered nonprofit with a 501(c)(3) status, which means it had to go through more checks to be considered safe and legitimate. Also, especially for breeders, make sure you can receive documentation on where the horse was bred, its lineage, and any health history. If none of this is provided, you might not be dealing with a quality organization.</p>
      <p>Spend plenty of time with the horse while it's still in the hands of the organization, so you can get to know it and make sure it's as healthy as the organization says. Look for any lameness, pain, trouble breathing, or other obvious signs of illness. You don't want to end up bringing home a special-needs horse when you are not prepared to care for one.</p>
