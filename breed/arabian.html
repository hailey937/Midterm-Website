      <h3>The Arabian Horse</h3>

      <p>The Arabian horse breed goes back thousands of years. Its striking beauty and even temperament have made it a popular breeding horse throughout the ages. Arabians have contributed their elegance, spirit, and intelligence to almost every light horse breed that exists. Many pony and warmblood breeds also count the athletic Arabian among their ancestors.</p>

      <h4>Arabian Horse History and Origins</h4>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12 text-indent">
      <p>While the very beginnings of the Arabian horse are hidden in the ancient desert sands, most experts agree Arabians originated in the vicinity of the Arabian Peninsula. The Bedouin tribes have traced their common history with these horses back to 3000 B.C., keeping meticulous ancestral records, or pedigrees. The modern breed's hardiness is a result of the harsh desert climate and terrain from which it evolved.</p>
      <p>The horses were used for transportation, hauling loads, and war mounts. So prized were these horses that some keepers brought them into their families' tents at night for warmth and protection.</p>
      <p>Eventually, Arabian horses spread throughout Europe and beyond due to both war and trade. Genghis Khan, Napoleon Bonaparte, George Washington, and Alexander the Great are among the many historical figures who owned and rode Arabians. And the prophet Mohammed urged his followers to treat their Arabian horses with kindness and respect.</p>
      <p>They arrived in the United States in the 1700s. And in 1908, the Arabian Horse Registry of America was founded.</p>

      <h4>Colors and Markings</h4>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12 text-indent">
      <p>The Arabian Horse Association recognizes the coat colors of bay, gray, chestnut, black, and roan. Arabians also can have white facial markings and socks or stockings on their legs. Some bloodlines are known for their specific appearances, such as the high white socks and white faces of the Crabbet bloodline.</p>
      <p>Arabians are never dun, cremello, palomino, or buckskin because purebreds don't carry dilutions genes. Sabino, a type of white pattern on the skin and coat, is the only spotted pattern now carried in pure Arabian lines.</p>
      <p>The skin of the Arabian horse is black, except for under white markings. The dark pigmentation protected the horses against the harsh desert sun.</p>

      <h4>Diet and Nutrition</h4>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12 text-indent">
      <p>Arabian horses require a healthy balance of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, minerals, vitamins, and water in their diet. Like most horses, they eat fresh grass, quality hay, grains, and some fruits and veggies. Because their ancestors came from deserts with scarce food, Arabians actually might require a little less feed than other breeds their size to maintain a healthy weight. But just as it’s crucial not to overfeed a horse, it’s also important to ensure you’re providing enough nutrition.</p>

      <h4>Is the Arabian Horse Right for You?</h4>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12 text-indent">
      <p>Arabian horses can be loving, loyal, and responsive companions. But they are hot-blooded and highly intelligent horses that need someone with equine experience to train them. Some older and well-trained Arabians—as well as Arabian crossbreeds—might work for a person with limited horse knowledge, though Arabians do typically remain active well into their golden years.</p>
      <p>Arabians tend to be more people-oriented than many other horse breeds, and they enjoy the company of their human families. They're generally a healthy and hardy breed, and they adapt well to a range of environments.</p>

      <h4>How to Adopt or Buy an Arabian Horse</h4>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12 text-indent">
      <p>The average price for an Arabian horse ranges from around $5,000 to $20,000, with horses from prized bloodlines sometimes costing considerably more. Because Arabians are a popular breed, they are fairly easy to find at reputable horse rescues or breeders.</p>
      <p>Make sure the organization can give you adequate information on the horse’s health, temperament, and history. And if possible, have your own vet check out the horse before you decide to bring it home. Also, spend time with the horse, and have the organization show you how it has been trained. If you ever feel the organization is not being transparent or rushing you through this process, you might consider looking elsewhere for your horse.</p>
